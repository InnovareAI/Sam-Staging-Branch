# Emergency Environment Variables for Email System Recovery
# Copy these to your .env.local file if email system is completely blocked

# Enable email bypass mode - redirects ALL emails to safe test addresses
# Set to 'true' to enable, remove or set to 'false' to disable
EMAIL_BYPASS_MODE=true

# Override email addresses for testing
# These will be used instead of real emails when bypass mode is enabled
EMERGENCY_TEST_EMAIL=test@blackhole.postmarkapp.com
EMERGENCY_ADMIN_EMAIL=tl@innovareai.com

# Postmark test settings - these don't actually send emails
POSTMARK_TEST_MODE=true
POSTMARK_SAFE_EMAIL=test@blackhole.postmarkapp.com

# Add these to your .env.local to enable emergency bypass mode:
# 1. Copy this file to .env.local
# 2. Restart your development server
# 3. All invitations will be redirected to safe test addresses
# 4. No real emails will be sent to potentially suppressed addresses

# Instructions:
# - When EMAIL_BYPASS_MODE=true, all emails go to test addresses
# - Use this mode to test invitation system without hitting suppressions
# - Disable bypass mode once suppressions are resolved
# - Check email suppression status via /api/admin/email-suppressions endpoint
