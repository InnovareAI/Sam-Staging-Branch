Your campaign should display as **SD Marketing CR Test 3**, not as a date string.\n\nThis looks like a formatting issue on the backend side. The search ran and found your prospect, but the campaign naming isn't displaying properly. I'd recommend checking Data Approval to see if the prospect data itself is correct, even if the campaign label looks off. Does the prospect information look good once you open it?",

If not, we might not have access to your 2nd degree network. Check the integrations in settings to confirm.\n2. **Search parameters** - Sometimes \"tech startup CEO\" is pretty specific. We might need to broaden it slightly (e.g., remove \"startup\" or expand location to Bay Area instead of just SF).\n3. **Network size** - Your 2nd degree network might not have many CEOs matching that exact combo right now.\n\nWant me to try a broader search (like removing \"startup\" or expanding to the Bay Area)? Or should we check if your LinkedIn is properly connected first?",

That's a system issue on my end, not user error.\n\nHere's what I need to do: I can't manually filter prospects in real-time searches, but I can help you work around this. When you go to **Data Approval**, you can **reject Adam Fry** directly in that tab, and the system should learn not to show him again. Alternatively, I can note his name in your exclusion list so future searches avoid him. Want me to add both Adam and Ruben to a permanent \"do not contact\" list?",

Here's a solid reply you can send:\n\n---\n\n**Subject:** Re: Products & How SAM Works for Consulting Firms\n\nHey [Prospect Name],\n\nI totally get it—juggling 4 clients operationally while managing demand is exactly the constraint we hear from consulting firms. That's actually why SAM is built for teams like yours.\n\nInstead of hiring more people to scale, SAM automates your prospecting and outreach so you can focus on delivering exceptional work to those 4 clients while growing revenue without growing headcount. We handle the lead research, LinkedIn outreach, and email campaigns end-to-end.\n\nOur products: ICP discovery, LinkedIn + email campaign automation, and AI-powered messaging that actually converts.\n\nWould a quick 15-min call make sense to map out your specific bottleneck? Happy to show you how other consulting firms are scaling without the overhead.\n\nBest,\n[Your Name]\n\n---\n\n**Quick note:** This works, but for *really* personalized messaging that matches your exact voice and positioning, the **Campaign Hub** is where you can tweak it, add specifics, and save templates for future replies. Want to refine it there, or does this feel good to send?",

But here's the thing: I can work with what *you* already know about them from your conversation.\n\nSince they just replied to you, you likely have context I can use:\n- **Their name** (from the email/message)\n- **Company name** (consulting firm they mentioned)\n- **What they said** (they're serving 4 clients, struggling with demand—that's gold)\n- **Any other details** from previous conversations or their LinkedIn profile you've seen\n\nI don't need to scrape their website or pull fresh data—I just need you to share what you already have access to. That's enough to make the reply feel genuinely personalized.\n\nCan you give me:\n1. Their name\n2. Their company\n3. Any other context from their message or profile (industry they serve, type of consulting, etc.)?\n\nThen I'll draft something that actually speaks to *their* situation, not a template.",

Here's a sharper version:\n\n---\n\n**Subject:** Re: Scaling Without the Headcount\n\nHey [Prospect Name],\n\nI hear you on capacity—4 clients maxed out operationally is real. Here's the thing: you don't need to hire more people to grow. You need autonomous systems.\n\nSAM handles the entire outreach pipeline automatically: prospecting, LinkedIn engagement, email sequences—all running in the background while your team focuses on delivery. No manual work, no bottlenecks.\n\nThink of it as adding a tireless sales layer that never sleeps. You set the ICP, we find the right prospects, and the automated outreach does the heavy lifting. Your team just closes.\n\nThat's how consulting firms like yours scale revenue without scaling headcount.\n\nQuick 15-min call to map your specific workflow?\n\nBest,\n[Your Name]\n\n---\n\n**Better?** This version emphasizes the *autonomous* angle—it's not about hiring, it's about letting systems do the work. Want me to adjust the tone, add more specifics about how the automation works, or refine anything else?",

Also, feel free to **paste a few sample rows** of your CSV here and I can check if anything looks off.",

You're targeting founders, VPs of Sales, and folks dealing with outbound scaling challenges.\n\n**Here's the thing though:** Your KB is 67% complete overall, which is great, but we're missing some critical context around **messaging** (33% done) and **success stories** (0% done). These gaps make a difference when we're personalizing outreach.\n\n**Quick question:** When you say \"ideal customer,\" are you asking about:\n1. **Who you're targeting right now** (the ICP we have loaded)?\n2. **Who's actually buying from you** (your best customers)?\n3. **Something else I should know?**\n\nLet me know and I can give you the real picture—or if you've got docs about your best customers or case studies, uploading those would help me paint a clearer picture fast.",

Get to know your business through conversation so I can power everything else.\n\nBefore I jump into your ideal customer, let me ask—have you got any docs handy? ICP profiles, product sheets, messaging decks, pricing guides? If you upload them to the **Knowledge Base** tab, I'll only ask questions to fill the gaps instead of starting from scratch. Saves us both time.\n\nWhat do you say—want to upload first, or should we just dive in with questions?",
