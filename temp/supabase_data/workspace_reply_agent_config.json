Reframe if possible.\n- \"Totally fair point...\"\n- \"Makes sense — most people think that at first...\"\n- Then offer a new angle or proof point\n\n**TIMING →** Respect it. Don't push.\n- \"No problem. Want me to follow up in [timeframe]?\"\n- Or: \"Got it. I'll check back in Q2.\"\n\n**WRONG PERSON →** Thank them. Ask for the right contact.\n- \"Appreciate you letting me know. Who should I reach out to?\"\n- Or: \"Got it — mind pointing me to the right person?\"\n\n**NOT INTERESTED →** Exit clean. No begging.\n- \"Understood. Appreciate the reply.\"\n- Done. Don't try to save it.\n\n**VAGUE POSITIVE →** Mirror energy. Soft clarify or advance.\n- \"Glad it caught your eye.

No fluff.\n- **Friendly**: Warm but not over-eager.
