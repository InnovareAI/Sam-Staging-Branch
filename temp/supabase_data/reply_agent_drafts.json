    "draft_text": "Hi Lisa,\n\nMost automated outreach tools blast generic messages at scale. SAM is different — it runs personalized LinkedIn + email sequences with human approval on every reply, so nothing goes out that doesn't sound like you. For HR Tech/DEI specifically, that matters because your buyers can smell automation a mile away.\n\nSince you're fundraising and hunting for B2B clients, SAM could run prospecting in the background while you focus on closes — basically an SDR for $99/month.\n\nHere's a quick demo if you want to see how it works: https://links.innovareai.com/SAM_Demo\n\nMerry Christmas and happy holidays!\n\nThorsten",
