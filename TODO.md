## 📦 Archived Completed Items

When a section gets too long (>20 items), move completed items to:
`/docs/archive/TODO_ARCHIVE_YYYY_MM.md`

---

## Usage Guidelines

### For Claude Code:
1. **Start of session**: Claude reads this file to understand current priorities
2. **During session**: Update this file as tasks are completed or added
3. **End of session**: Move completed items to "Recently Completed"

### For You:
- Keep "URGENT" section small (3-5 items max)
- Archive completed items monthly
- Be specific with task descriptions

### What NOT to Put Here:
- Detailed implementation notes (use separate design docs)
- Long code snippets (reference files instead)
- Historical context (use archive files)
