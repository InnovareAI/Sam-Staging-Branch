**What we need:** Access to your LinkedIn account via our secure connection

**How it works:**
- We'll send you a secure link to connect your LinkedIn account

- Sam can then comment, like, and engage as you

**Important:** Your login credentials are never stored - we use LinkedIn's official authentication

```
https://www.linkedin.com/in/johndoe/

```
