## Common Objections & Responses

### "I don't want to spam people"

**Response:** SAM isn't about spam - it's about personalized, relevant outreach. Every message is AI-personalized based on the prospect's profile. We limit volume to stay under LinkedIn's radar. Think of SAM as your assistant who does research before every outreach.

---

### "I'm worried about LinkedIn restrictions"

**Response:** SAM is built with LinkedIn safety in mind:
- We respect daily/weekly limits
- Messages are spaced 30+ minutes apart
- No browser extensions (those get flagged)
- Human-like behavior patterns
- Thousands of users without issues

---

### "I already have leads, I need to close them"

**Response:** SAM handles top-of-funnel so you can focus on bottom-of-funnel. While you're closing current deals, SAM fills tomorrow's pipeline. Most founders say the hardest part is staying consistent with prospecting while busy closing - SAM solves that.

---

### "My business is too relationship-based for automation"

**Response:** SAM doesn't replace relationships - it starts them. You still have every conversation personally. SAM just does the initial outreach at scale, then hands off to you the moment someone responds. Think of it as a very efficient networking assistant.

---

### "I tried automation before and it didn't work"

**Response:** Most automation tools fail because they send generic messages. SAM is different - it uses AI to personalize every message based on the prospect's actual profile. Our users see 30-40% connection acceptance rates vs. 10-15% with template-based tools.

---

### "It's too expensive"

**Response:** Compare to alternatives:
- 1 SDR: $60-80K/year + benefits
- Freelance prospecting: $20-40/hour
- Your time: Priceless

SAM costs less than one day of SDR time per month, and runs 24/7.

---

### "I don't have time to set it up"

**Response:** Setup takes about 30 minutes:
1. Connect your LinkedIn (2 min)
2. Upload prospects or define search (5 min)
3. Customize your message sequence (15 min)
4. Launch campaign

After that, SAM runs itself. You just review replies.
