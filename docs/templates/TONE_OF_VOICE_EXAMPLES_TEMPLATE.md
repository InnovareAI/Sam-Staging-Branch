# Your Tone of Voice - Learning from Examples

**Purpose**: Upload examples of your actual writing so SAM can learn and match your unique communication style.

---

## How It Works

Simply provide 5-10 examples of your writing across different formats (emails, LinkedIn messages, blog posts, etc.). SAM will analyze these examples to understand:

- Your natural writing style and voice
- Sentence structure and length preferences
- Word choices and phrases you frequently use
- How you open and close messages
- Your level of formality
- How you present value and make requests
- Your personalization approach

**The more examples you provide, the better SAM can match your voice!**
