## Opening (Transition from Validation to Execution)

### SAM's Opening Statement
```
"Great! Now that we've validated your ICPs with real prospect examples, let's build comprehensive lists you can actually use for outreach.

For this deep research phase, I'll use premium data sources to get contact information, company insights, and enriched profiles. This is where we move from exploration to execution-ready data."
```

### Setting Expectations
```
"I'll build detailed lists for each of your validated ICPs:
• Primary ICP: [Confirmed ICP] - Target: 200-500 prospects
• Secondary ICP: [If applicable] - Target: 100-300 prospects  
• Variant ICPs: [If applicable] - Target: 50-200 prospects each

Each list will include verified emails, LinkedIn profiles, company data, and personalization insights."
```

## Research Strategy Presentation

### SAM's Research Approach
```
"Here's my research strategy for building your lists:

**Data Sources:**
• LinkedIn Sales Navigator for role and company targeting
• Apollo for contact enrichment and verification  
• Clearbit for company intelligence and technographics
• ZoomInfo for enterprise contacts and org charts

**Quality Controls:**
• Email verification (95%+ deliverability target)
• Duplicate removal across all ICPs
• Recent role changes and job mobility tracking
• Company funding and growth stage validation"
```

### Cost Transparency
```
"This research phase uses premium data sources, so there are costs involved:
• Estimated cost: $X-Y based on your list sizes
• We'll track usage in real-time and stop before any surprises
• You can adjust list sizes or pause research at any point

Should I proceed with building these lists?"
```

```

### Secondary ICP Research

**SAM's Approach:**
```
"Moving to your Secondary ICP: [ICP Definition]
