## 🏢 TEMPLATE CATEGORY 4: INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC

### Template 4A: SaaS Companies
```
Hi {{first_name}}, {{company_name}} faces the classic SaaS challenge: predictable pipeline generation.

SaaS companies need consistent, qualified leads to hit recurring revenue targets. Most teams struggle with either volume (not enough outreach) or quality (generic messaging that doesn't convert).

Best regards,
[Your name]

### Template 4B: Professional Services
```
Hi {{first_name}}, professional services firms like {{company_name}} often rely heavily on referrals and networking.

While referrals are great, most firms need additional systematic approaches to prospect generation, especially during slower referral periods.

We help consulting and professional services firms supplement referrals with strategic, authentic outreach that feels natural and builds genuine relationships.

Worth discussing how we help firms like {{company_name}} create more predictable business development?

Best,
[Your name]

We help manufacturers create authentic connections with decision-makers through intelligent, research-based outreach that respects the B2B buying process.

Worth discussing how we help manufacturing companies build meaningful buyer relationships at scale?

Best regards,
[Your name]

## 🎯 TEMPLATE CATEGORY 5: PAIN POINT FOCUSED

### Template 5A: Pipeline Consistency
```
Hi {{first_name}}, consistent pipeline is probably one of {{company_name}}'s biggest priorities right now.

Most companies struggle with feast-or-famine pipeline - great months followed by dry spells. This makes forecasting and resource planning nearly impossible.

We help companies create predictable, consistent pipeline through systematic, intelligent outreach that generates steady flow of qualified opportunities.

Interested in discussing how to create more predictable pipeline for {{company_name}}?

Best,
[Your name]
```

### Template 5B: Manual Prospecting Burnout
```
Hi {{first_name}}, bet your team at {{company_name}} spends too much time writing individual prospect messages.

Manual personalization doesn't scale - and generic messages don't convert. Most sales teams are stuck choosing between efficiency and effectiveness.

Our AI-powered system gives you both: the personal touch that drives responses, with the efficiency that enables scale.

Worth a quick conversation about how we help teams like yours escape the manual prospecting trap?

Best regards,
[Your name]
```

### Template 5C: Low Response Rates
```
Hi {{first_name}}, low response rates are probably hurting {{company_name}}'s outreach ROI.

When response rates drop, teams either send more volume (spam territory) or fewer messages (missed opportunities). Neither approach works long-term.

We help companies achieve 8-15% response rates consistently through intelligent personalization that feels authentic and relevant.

Interested in seeing how we help companies like {{company_name}} dramatically improve their outreach effectiveness?

Best,
[Your name]
