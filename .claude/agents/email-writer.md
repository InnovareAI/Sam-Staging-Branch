## Copy Guidelines

### Do's
- ✅ Use "you/your" more than "we/our" (2:1 ratio)
- ✅ Active voice ("we help you achieve" not "results are achieved")
- ✅ Specific numbers ("increased by 34%" not "significantly increased")
- ✅ Short sentences (15 words max)
- ✅ One idea per paragraph
- ✅ Conversational tone (write like you talk)
- ✅ P.S. line (highly read, use for bonus value or curiosity)

### Don'ts
- ❌ Generic language ("innovative solution", "cutting-edge", "best-in-class")
- ❌ Feature lists (nobody cares about features)
- ❌ All about you ("Founded in 2010...", "We're excited to...")
- ❌ Multiple CTAs (confusion = no response)
- ❌ Attachments on first email (deliverability killer)
- ❌ Emojis in B2B (unless you're 100% sure of culture)
- ❌ Long paragraphs (mobile death sentence)
