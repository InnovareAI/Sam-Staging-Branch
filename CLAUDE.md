# CLAUDE.md - SAM AI Platform Instructions & Context

## CRITICAL OPERATING MODE INSTRUCTIONS

### Guardrails Reference
See `CLAUDE_GUARDRAILS_MASTERFILE.md` for comprehensive operational guidelines and constraints.

### TODO Management System - MANDATORY
**CRITICAL**: Use TODO tracking for ALL tasks. This is STRICTLY ENFORCED:

1. **Before starting ANY task**: Track in todo system with context
2. **During work**: Update status actively
3. **Upon completion**: IMMEDIATELY mark as completed with:
   - Implementation description
   - All files modified
   - Key decisions made
4. **Never skip**: This prevents context loss and enables task replication
5. **Always reference**: Check previous implementations before starting similar tasks

### Orchestration Protocol
**ORCHESTRATION & EXECUTION MODE** - Strategic planning with direct execution:

**🚨 MANDATORY SUBAGENT RULE - NO EXCEPTIONS 🚨**
**BEFORE STARTING ANY TASK, THE AGENT MUST:**
1. **READ CLAUDE.md** - Full context and current project status
2. **READ CLAUDE_GUARDRAILS_MASTERFILE.md** - All operational constraints
3. **CONFIRM UNDERSTANDING** - Explicitly state what was read and understood
4. **GET EXPLICIT APPROVAL** - Cannot proceed without user confirmation

**WITHOUT THIS RECONFIRMATION PROCESS, NO TASKS ARE ALLOWED TO START**

1. **PLANNING & STRATEGY**
   - Analyze requirements and break down complex tasks
   - Create execution plans for features
   - Monitor progress and ensure task completion
   - Coordinate multiple operations efficiently

2. **EXECUTION APPROACH**
   - Use appropriate tools for each task
   - Maintain thoroughness in all operations
   - Execute tasks in parallel when possible
   - Follow existing patterns in codebase

3. **WORKFLOW**
   - Step 0: **MANDATORY**: Read CLAUDE.md and CLAUDE_GUARDRAILS_MASTERFILE.md
   - Step 0.5: **MANDATORY**: Confirm understanding and get user approval
   - Step 1: Analyze user request and create strategic plan
   - Step 2: **MANDATORY**: Track all tasks before proceeding
   - Step 3: Break down into executable tasks
   - Step 4: Execute with appropriate tools
   - Step 5: Monitor and validate results
   - Step 6: **MANDATORY**: Update task tracking upon completion
   - Step 7: Provide clear summary of completed work

## Important Instruction Reminders
- Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less
- NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal
- ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one
- NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files unless explicitly requested

### Recent Issues & Status (2025-01-09)

#### ❌ CRITICAL AUTHENTICATION ISSUES
- **Sign-in Flow Broken**: Users cannot complete authentication process
- **Organization Setup Loop**: After sign-in, users stuck in "Setup your organization" screen
- **Landing Page Issues**: Authentication gating not working as intended
- **Loading State Problems**: Infinite loading or redirect loops

#### ✅ Previous Fixes (Now Potentially Broken)
- **Fixed middleware.ts**: Sam API routes now allow authentication context without blocking
- **Resolved "Failed to load conversations"**: Proper 401/403 handling in useSamChat hook
- **Added logout functionality**: Visible SignOutButton with LogOut icon for better UX

#### ✅ Deployment Configuration (Working)
- **Netlify Node.js upgrade**: From v18 to v20 (required by Supabase)
- **Next.js deployment fix**: Removed conflicting publish directory configuration
- **Environment variables**: All production keys configured (Clerk, Supabase, OpenRouter, Postmark)

#### ✅ Sam AI Integration (Backend Working)
- **OpenRouter + Claude 3.5 Sonnet**: Intelligent sales assistant responses
- **Fallback system**: Graceful degradation when API keys unavailable
- **Conversation persistence**: Messages stored in Supabase with metadata
- **Multi-tenant isolation**: Workspace-based data segregation

### Critical Business Rules
1. **Multi-tenant isolation** - Each organization's data must be completely separated
2. **AI conversations persist** - All interactions saved for context
3. **Real-time updates** - Changes reflect immediately across all connected clients
4. **Enterprise security** - SOC 2 compliance requirements
5. **Scalability first** - Architecture must support thousands of concurrent users

### Testing Workflow
1. Local development on port 5173 (Vite) or 3000 (Next.js)
2. Deploy to staging via `npm run deploy:staging`
3. Test on staging URL
4. Deploy to production only after approval

### Documentation
- **README.md** - Complete setup, deployment, and troubleshooting guide
- **DEPLOYMENT_TROUBLESHOOTING.md** - Detailed deployment issue resolution
- **CLAUDE.md** - Development context and technical specifications

### URGENT TODO LIST
1. **Fix Clerk Organization Setup Loop**
   - Users stuck in organization creation after successful sign-in
   - Need to investigate Clerk configuration and organization flow
   - Check if organization creation is required or optional

2. **Resolve Authentication Flow**
   - Landing page showing for authenticated users
   - Sign-in redirecting incorrectly
   - Loading states not resolving properly

3. **Test Complete User Journey**
   - Anonymous user → Landing page → Sign-in → Authenticated app
   - Ensure no loops or broken redirects
   - Verify all features accessible after authentication

### Recent Failed Attempts
- Added authentication gating (created more issues)
- Modified loading state logic (didn't resolve core problem)
- Multiple deployment attempts without fixing root cause
- Violated TODO tracking protocol during debugging

### CRITICAL ENFORCEMENT RULES
- **🚨 SUBAGENT RULE**: Read CLAUDE.md + CLAUDE_GUARDRAILS_MASTERFILE.md before ANY task - NO EXCEPTIONS
- **🚨 CONFIRMATION REQUIRED**: Must explicitly confirm understanding and get user approval before proceeding
- **🚨 NO TASK EXECUTION**: Without proper file reading and confirmation, NO WORK IS ALLOWED
- **ALWAYS use TodoWrite tool for task tracking** (MANDATORY per CLAUDE.md)
- ALWAYS test on staging before production deployment
- ENSURE multi-tenant data isolation in all queries
- MAINTAIN conversation context across sessions
- CHECK authentication on all API routes
- VALIDATE tenant permissions before data access
- **DO NOT make changes without proper TODO tracking**
